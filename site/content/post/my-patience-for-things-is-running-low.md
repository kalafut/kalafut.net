title: My Patience for "Things" is Running Low

[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things) is one of the best designed apps for iOS and Mac, and it has been my task list of choice for many years. I've been happy with it, and really enjoy its ergonomics vs. Todoist, which I was coming from. Yet my patience is running low.

Things has clearly been actively development, as shown on their excellent [release notes](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/1100684/) . Yet I also feel it has stagnated in the areas I care about. There is often healthy discussion around when software can just be considered "Done", and how a lack of new marquee features doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. My argument to that would be it is entirely dependent on the user as to what they consider Done, and the author needs to communicate their version of the status.

Communication is probably the key gripe I have with Culture Code:

* Their blog was just updated for iOS 16, but the previous update was nearly a year ago.
* Tweets are similarly rare
* Even their [main web page](https://web.archive.org/web/20220826181634/https://culturedcode.com/things/) is, as of this writing, still touting "The all-new Things"... as it has for nearly 5 years ([5/2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170518164151/https://culturedcode.com/things/))

So with little official communication, users are left wondering whether their improve request, feature, bug fix, etc. has been prioritized, rejected, deferred to a new Things 4 (will that even exist?). The total lack of roadmap is just frustrating to deal with. If there are no plans to add feature X, then I feel that no communicating that, and letting people hold on hoping in vain for months and years, is just a crummy way to run things. I'm not looking for release dates, but at least a high level roadmap, even annually, of what they're considering would be a big improvement.

Some of the specific items I'm hoping for:

#### Images

Being restricted to text notes in Thing is probably my biggest gripe. Use a similar app with the feature and it is apparent how incredibly convenient it is. I don't want my photo album filled with pictures of a box of screws I need to pick at Home Depot, or the random screenshot of a bug report, or of the sign advertise soccer signup info. I want that *on* the task I'm going to action. That's the best and only place for that information!

To the GTD adherents who consider this "project support" material meant for some other system, I ask why then did Things recently put out a task notes update to support Markdown?  It's clear that customers will want to attach a variety of task-relevant material to the task, and most competing apps allow this. 

#### Location Reminders

This a perplexing one. If nothing else I consider Cultured Code to be a premier Mac/iOS development shop, and something like location alerts seems like the sort of OS feature they'd be keen to expose on launch day. But years later, nothing. It might be a smaller feature, but when needed it is very useful, and it something has made its way to many task managers. 

#### Search in share sheets

OK this is really small, but I encounter it multiple times per day.

#### Bug Fixes

It's clear that Cultured Code is committed to quality and is constantly refining the apps. So I was surprised when, after providing a detailed repro doc about broken repeating tasks, their response was simply that they're working on a major overhaul to the repeating system and had to ETA to fix the bug. A similar bug reported in the App Store got the same response. While I understand their focus is on the "real" fix of shift to the new system, something as core as repeating tasks can just linger in a broken state.
