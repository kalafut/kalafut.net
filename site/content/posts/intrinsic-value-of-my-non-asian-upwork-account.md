This email request is headed right to the Spam bin, but it was nonetheless interesting to see how the flattening of the world continues to take place, how rates level out, how folks work around regional imbalances, etc.:

> I'm XXX from China and I found you on GitHub. 
> As a full-stack web developer, I have worked in my local company for a long time.
> But I want to work as a freelancer on Upwork using the European Upwork account now.
>
> * Why do I need to use the European Upwork account?
>   As you know, Europeans are easier than Asians to work on Upwork and to get a high hourly rate.
>   Really it is so difficult to get good jobs using the Asian Upwork account on Upwork.
>   So I don't use a China(Asian) account and want to only use the European Upwork account.
> * How can I use your Upwork account?
>   If you have an Upwork account and don't use it, I wanna use it on your local computer via Teamviewer or Anydesk.
>   If not, you can create a new account for me.
>   Also, I think if you use your Upwork account part-time, you can use it with me.
>   Only I will use your account while you don't use your account.
> * How can we transfer money with each other?
>   You can add Payoneer or Paypal to your Upwork account and If I earn some money using your Upwork account, we can withdraw it via your Payoneer or Paypal.
>   And then you can get 10 % of the money from there and you can send the rest of the money to my Paypal or Payoneer.
> * Why do I need access to your locale via Teamviewer or Anydesk?
>   If I use your Upwork account using a virtual server such as VPN, VPS, AWS, Upwork detects the proxy server IP and blocks your account.
>   So If I can use your account, I must absolutely use it on your local computer via Teamviewer or Anydesk.
>   If you worry about your personal secret data on your computer, you can set a VM on your computer and I can use your account on the VM of your computer.
> * You don't have to worry about me stealing and have your Upwork account. Why?
>   Really there isn't a need to steal and have your Upwork account without you.
>   If I use your account on another location using VPN, VPS, your account will be blocked because of an IP location change.
>   Also, Upwork requires video chat sometimes, I can't do it without your help.
>
> I am looking forward to hearing from you soon
