I just discovered that my kalafut.net domain had a birthday yesterday ! It is now 21 years old, first registered by Min on 2002-11-02. That’s a long time ago! It has been incredibly useful over the years. I’ve changed email providers, probably four times, and moved blogs all over the place, but the little piece of Internet property that I staked out always remained the same. And now it is even multi generational. Both of my kids have email addresses against it, which are also there, iCloud addresses, which is how they would actually communicate with their friends (I think they’ve used email once or twice in their lives)
