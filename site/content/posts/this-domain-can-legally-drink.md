I just discovered that my kalafut.net domain had a birthday yesterday! It is now **21** years old, first registered by me on 2002-11-02. That’s a long time ago! 

Owning a domain has been incredibly useful over the years. I’ve changed email providers multiple times and moved blogs all over the place, but the little piece of internet property that I staked out during the George W Bush administration always remained the same. And now it is even multi-generational: both of my kids have email addresses against it. To be clear, I don't think they've written more than two emails in their lives, but ...@kalafut.net is nonetheless useful as an iCloud email address, and iMessage is something they very much do use.

So happy birthday, kalafut.net. 🍻
