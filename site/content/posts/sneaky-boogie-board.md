[Boogie Boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boogie_board_(product)) are pretty handy for the kids. They’re durable and the batteries last forever. Well, *almost* forever. We just had one die and I was dismayed to see “Battery not user replacable“ on the back. Throw this whole thing away?!?

But there were four screws… Small, but Philips head, so I opened it up. A CR2025 battery was propped up, in a holder, ready to be replaced. 

I had a replacement on hand, and swapping it worked fine. It looks like the engineers wanted this to be user servicable, designed it such, but just couldn’t say it was.
