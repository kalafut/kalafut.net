I don't watch much TV these days. I used to watch more and have found that good intro/title sequences hold as much memory for me as the show.

I remember dozens of fun ([Friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2TyVQGoCYo)), catchy ([The Jeffersons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-OnRQ4P0VY)), cool ([Knight Rider ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNyXYPhnUIs)& [Airwolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULfmowbNlK0)) themes from my earlier, but the best intros are more recent and tend to capture the vibe of a whole show in under 2 minutes.

It wasn't easy to pare it down to five, nor rank them, but here are mine:.

1. [The Sopranos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJpNmYeooQE)
2. [House of Cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w-O60x1bYk)
3. [Succession](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77PsqaWzwG0)
4. [True Detective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xyu_MdKBXic)
5. [Big Little Lies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF_1iPFr6Dw)

Honorable mention due to mega-nostalgia: [Hill Street Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUX3TPKVf_Y)
