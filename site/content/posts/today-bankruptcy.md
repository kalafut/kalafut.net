Despite [my recent critique of Things](/posts/my-patience-for-things-is-running-low/), it is still my main task organization tool. One of the main views in the app is the "Today" view. This *should* be my driver throughout the day, but because of how disorganized I am, it can sometimes become cluttered with a large number of aspirational tasks that I wanted to get to, but never did. What happens then is that instead of being an useful tool to keep my day on track, it is a superset of "nice to do" tasks. l then end up pushing tasks around based on what I *really* want to do today. Not great. And once the list grows long enough, it can be downright depressing to open.

I could simply clear the date from all of the tasks—[Inbox bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_bankruptcy) style—I but that triggers a different type of anxiety. Unlike my Inbox, *I* added all these tasks throughout the day, and only certain ones got added to Today (easy: `⌘-T`). So being in Today at all does imply a higher priority that I don't want to lose through a mass clearing. 

My solution to this conundrum is to use tags. I have a parent tag called `today_bankruptcy`, and when I decide the Today view has become unwieldy and I need to clean it up, I make a dated child tag and apply it to everything in the Today view. Then I remove the date from all the tasks.

This gives me some immediate relief from the crushing overload of tasks, allowing me a fresh start at day management. But I can still subsequently review any "bankruptcy" tags and move or update them as needed.
