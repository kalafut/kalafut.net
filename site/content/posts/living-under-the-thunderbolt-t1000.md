Behold the [Thunderbolt 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(siren)) series siren:

Midwesterners of a certain age will feel their blood run cold when it's blower motor winds up and the siren starts blaring. I grew up in Naperville, IL, less than 300' from one of these. Here's exactly where it was perched, now featuring a different siren: [Google Streeview](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.7477834,-88.1350469,3a,75y,289.31h,108.44t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1snIR4zNMWkkKRo4ldX4hhqA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DnIR4zNMWkkKRo4ldX4hhqA%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.share%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26yaw%3D289.30785989636723%26pitch%3D-18.43564057003364%26thumbfov%3D90!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu>). I don't know what the new one sounds like.

The sound really was the stuff of nightmares--my nightmares! Tornado threats loomed large in my youth, and on multiple occasions I ended up driving through their aftermath (Barneveld, Plainfield). For a while I had recurring tornado nightmares, and this siren always featured promimently. This makes sense since they'd run siren tests every month (oh, its *that* Tuesday), and [apparently still do](https://www.naperville.il.us/services/naperville-fire-department/emergency-preparedness/be-informed/outdoor-warning-siren-system/).

Now that I've really sold it, if you'd like to experience the Thunderbolt yourself, the internet has you covered with an extremely good recording:

Aside from the startup growl (usually associated with ðŸ˜±), I vividly remember the spooky sounding echos as it winds down, around 1:15 in the video. The echos are surprising given the flat, suburban environment, but it's hard to overstate just how damn loud the thing was.
