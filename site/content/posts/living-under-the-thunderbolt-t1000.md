Behold the [Thunderbolt 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(siren)) series siren:

Midwesterners of a certain age will feel their blood run cold when it's blower motor winds up and the siren starts blaring. I grew up in the 90s in Naperville, IL, less than 300' from one of these. Here's exactly where it was perched, now featuring a different siren: [Google Streeview](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.7477834,-88.1350469,3a,75y,289.31h,108.44t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1snIR4zNMWkkKRo4ldX4hhqA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DnIR4zNMWkkKRo4ldX4hhqA%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.share%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26yaw%3D289.30785989636723%26pitch%3D-18.43564057003364%26thumbfov%3D90!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu>)

I don't know what the new one sounds like.

The sound really was the stuff of nightmaresâ€”my nightmares! Tornado threats loomed large in my youth, and on multiple occasions I ended up driving through their aftermath ([Barneveld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak_of_June_7%E2%80%938,_1984), [Plainfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Plainfield_tornado)). For a while I had recurring tornado nightmares, and this siren always featured promimently. This makes sense since they'd run siren tests every month (oh, its *that* Tuesday), and [apparently still do](https://www.naperville.il.us/services/naperville-fire-department/emergency-preparedness/be-informed/outdoor-warning-siren-system/).

Now that I've really sold it, if you'd like to experience the Thunderbolt yourself, the internet has you covered with an extremely good recording:

Aside from the startup growl (usually associated with ðŸ˜±), I vividly remember the spooky-sounding echos as it winds down, around [1:15](https://youtu.be/d9rRSY0dRIU?t=75) in the video. The echoes are surprising, given the flat, suburban environment, but it's hard to overstate just how damn loud the thing was.

From the [Service Manual](https://web.archive.org/web/20220730161818/http://www.civildefensemuseum.com/sirens/manuals/thunderbolt/Tbolt-2.pdf) we can see exactly how loud:

70 dB at 1 mile, 80 dB (Apple Watches will alert "Loud Environment") at 1Â½ mile, and precisely loud AF dB at 250', which is where our house was.

I left the tornadoes and sirens 15 years ago when we moved to Oregon. I'm happy to not think about tornadoes much, though I do miss a good thunderstorm.
