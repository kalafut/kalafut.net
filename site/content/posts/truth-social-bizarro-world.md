Most of the online places I visit are politically left-leaning. But I‚Äôm usually there for the content quality instead of the political persuasion. For example, the NYT is undeniably left-biased, but they do have news with extensive reporting and a lot of data and supporting references. When I visit Fox News, it is mostly just ads for catheters and testosterone therapy, plus some salacious Hollywood gossip. Even the comments complain about how little news is there. (Note: I‚Äôm specifically talking about the website. A select few Fox TV programs are pretty good.)

What about social/discussion platforms? X/Mastodon/Bluesky all feel similarly ‚Äúlefty.‚Äù This, to me, gets boring and predictable, and I've always preferred a better, richer debate. I didn‚Äôt expect to find much *debate* on [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/), the famously Donald Trump-aligned platform, but I was hoping for some other points of view. The site advertises itself as, "... America's "Big Tent" social media platform that encourages an open, free, and honest global conversation without discriminating on the basis of political ideology." Sounds great!

Well... I‚Äôve been on the site for a few days, and my initial impression is that it is not very interesting. My issues with it are not at all left/right related, but just the general type and quality of content:

### Variety
Or lack thereof. Here are the Trending Topics as of yesterday:

1. MAGA
2. Trump2024
3. tiktok
4. tiktokban
5. TrumpWon
6. Trump
7. HunterBiden
8. Truth

I'm sure conservatives want to discuss more than Trump, but it is not easy to find on Truth Social. All content leads back to Trump.

### Noise
 An article will be posted, and then there will be 100s of "#MAGA", "#FJB", "#Bidenomics", etc. type comments. That's literally the whole comment. It is just noisy garage that adds nothing and makes it hard to find more substantive posts.

### Ads
Lots of ads trying to sell me gold, prepper supplies, weird investment schemes, Trump/flag/eagle/FJB clothing.

### Begging
So much of Trump & sons asking for money.

### Conspiracy Theories
* "Joe is in gitmo!"
* "Joe is dead!"
* "Nancy and the CIA colluded to make J6 happen!"

There aren't even links to learn more about these things, and it is usually just people repeating the same thing repeatedly, and saying you're a traitor if you question anything. ü•±

### Fact-free Zone
On the contrary, when people post more scientific stuff, like NASA publishing a report about some research, the usual response is that it is all fake, made up, and that the agency is a deep state construct. Who can actually take offense to a finding that there are earthquakes on the moon?!? Truth Social, apparently!

### Low quality
For example from yesterday:

"Our military is a disgrace to our soldiers."

This doesn't make sense. Maybe the person meant "military leadership"? The problem is that many comments are this type of word salad that is hard to understand. It is tedious to read.

## Conclusion

Overall, Truth Social is a disappointing site and doesn't offer a useful opposing view. I'll keep looking.
