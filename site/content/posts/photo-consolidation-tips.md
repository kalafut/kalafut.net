I'm trying to once and for all get all of my photos and videos into Apple Photos. I've been using it as my main app for years, and a lot of stuff is already there, but there are plenty of old photo archives from previous setups, various backups and migrations, and one-off duplicate folders of stuff for who knows what purpose. My concern about losing data has resulted in a highly duplicated message of 100s of GBs.

Wrangling this is a challenge. Some of the major tasks/challenges are:
- Get data in. Obvious, but still a challenge when talking about 100s of GB in remote location (S3, GCloud, etc)
- Don't duplicate. A lot of this stuff is already in Photos, however...
- ...achieve some level of organization. The way Apple Photos works, one can have loads of files simply in the the "Library", with no album or folder association, and often time with no accurate metadata. More file-centric storage location often have valuable clues, like a folder named "2006-04-03 Disneyland", and correcting metadata upon import may be the only reasonable change to capture it once the other source goes away (which is a goal).
