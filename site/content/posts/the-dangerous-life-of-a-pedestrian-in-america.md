Today, I was leaving the store and what drove by neatly captured America's attitude towards pedestrians. It was an F350 outfitted with a heavily customized "Iron Cross" front bumper with actual spikes.

I didn't catch a photo in time, but the one from [this project on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trucks/comments/10z8iea/thinking_about_mass_production_of_this_bumper/) is similar. Why is he allowed to drive this thing in public? Easy: because he can.

Given the country's anemic pedestrian protection laws, someone wanting to drive a dangerous vehicle has wide latitude. We're decades behind many countries in establishing basic protections and are fighting a pervasive attitude that pedestrians really don't matter. It's not just that the US is car-loving, and much urban planning revolves around it. Many folks are outright anti-pedestrian.

While people will concede to having sidewalks, they're annoyed when pedestrians might want to cross busier roads. Pedestrian right-of-way laws are often mocked, and regularly ignored. In my neighborhood, a marked crosswalk is nearly impossible to cross during rush hour. People won't even notice that you're trying to cross. My attempts at getting a crossing light installed haven't yielded much. The opposition is from the county: the flashing light might cause traffic to back up, affecting cars on a larger highway. The priority here is pretty clear. Yes, the pedestrian has the right of way, but it's really up to them to figure out how to exercise that right without getting killed.

# Equipment

## Offensive
Back to our friend with the Mad Max-inspired truck. US trucks (and some cars) are commonly equipped with more modest [bullbars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullbar) which greatly increase the danger to pedestrians. (As if it isn't already dangerous enough with everyone driving a monster truck?) Illegal heavily regulated in many countries, they're commonplace here. What value do these provide to the suburbanites I see driving around the neighborhood? Simple: they complete the macho picture. A huge truck with a matte finish, adorned with outdoorsy accessories like winches and fuel tanks. Maybe these see use in the wilderness occasionally, but more likely, they're seen picking up groceries or the kids from school. 

## Defensive
The biggest opportunity for improvementâ€“is the trucking industry. Truck side guards are ubiquitous (required by law!) in many countries and have been shown to substantially reduce the chance of fatal injury to cyclists and other vehicles in the event of a side collision. But in the US you rarely seen them.

It is pretty obvious what the difference between a cyclist deflecting off versus going under this truck would be. Advocacy campaigns prompted by tragedies involving kids (e.g. [The Jessica Campaign](http://thejessicacampaign.ca)).

Less obvious is the protection afforded  to those in vehicles that a side (or rear) guard can make ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKP5Djjt2Vs)).

These devices are not particularly costly and can be retrofitted easily. When I was in London last summer, I noticed that even small trucks with just a little bit of ground clearance would have side guards.

The US lags far behind, despite government-funded studies about their efficacy and recommendations supporting them. The reason is, of course, has been a history industry lobbying against them. And would we expect anything else, given the disregard for pedestrian safety, even at an individual level?

But at least on the side-guard issue, there is at least *some* movement. Individual municipalities are taking action, and there is at least technical support from the government ([Volpe](https://www.volpe.dot.gov/LPDs) to help with these efforts.
