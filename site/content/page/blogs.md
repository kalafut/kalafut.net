Blogs are great things to write, regardless of whether anyone reads them. They're the only diary I've ever even
semi-regularly kept. I've always hosted my own blogs and feel strongly that entrusting your autobiography
only to Twitter and/or Facebook is a risky idea.

A number of blogs have accumulated over the years. They're usually associated with some phase of my (our)
life, and I like the idea of putting them in [read-only/archive mode](/posts/2016-05-21-staticizing_wordpress/) when appropriate.
