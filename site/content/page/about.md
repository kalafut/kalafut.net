My name is Jim and I've liked technology for as long as I can remember. I've had hobbies and formal
education in electronics, but software is my real passion and I've been working with it for a long time.
There once was a time when I *pored* over QuickBasic manuals (back when manuals had heft), wrote BBS tools and watched the x86 platform evolve. Today I follow and participate in open source software, mainly in the areas of mobile/web/backend technologies.

Welcome to the latest incarnation/ of my online hub. I can be contacted in the usual places (see footer), or via good ol' [email](mailto:jim@kalafut.net)!
